## Getting started

> Both development and production environments require Docker and Docker Compose, make sure they are installed and running on your machine before starting

### Running the development server

1. Create an `.env.dev` file, use the [provided sample](sample%20.env.dev) as a starting point

2. Build the containers

```sh
docker-compose -f dev.yml build
```

3. Create a super user for the admin panel

```sh
docker-compose -f dev.yml run backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Start the containers

```sh
docker-compose -f dev.yml up
```

5. VoilÃ , you're all set!

URLs:

- Admin panel: `admin.localhost:8000`
- REST API: `api.localhost:8000/v2`
- Frontend website: `localhost:3000`

---

## Deployment

0. Initial server setup. [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) has a very nice [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04)
1. Once the server setup is complete, ssh into the server and clone the repository to home (or any) directory
2. Create an `.env.prod` file, use the [provided sample](sample%20.env.prod) as a starting point.
3. Move to `/docker/prod/nginx/` and create an `app.conf` file, use the [provided sample](docker/prod/nginx/sample%20app.conf) as a starting point.

> Make sure to change localhost with your domain

4. Build the containers

```sh
docker-compose -f prod.yml build
```

5. Create a super user for the admin panel (please don't use admin/admin ðŸ˜‰)

```sh
docker-compose -f prod.yml run backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Start the containers

```sh
docker-compose -f prod.yml up -d
```

7. Done

Your server should be running now and accessible by its IP address

### Cloudflare

It is recommended to connect your domain to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) for easy and quick DNS setup.

#### Add required DNS records

Once your cloudflare is set up, add the following records:

| Type | Name                | Content                |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| A    | `admin`             | your server IP address |
| A    | `api`               | your server IP address |
| A    | `[your_domain].com` | your server IP address |
| A    | `www.admin`         | your server IP address |
| A    | `www.api`           | your server IP address |
| A    | `www`               | your server IP address |

#### Set up HTTPS

In Cloudflare dashboard, move to the "SSL/TLS" tap, and enable the "Flexible" option

#### Make good use of Cloudflare free features

Cloudflare provides a set of great free features, expolore the dashboard and make sure to enable them!

## Make it yours

To configure and custimze the app to suite your needs, I recommend forking the repository and follow the following steps

> While this app allows for lots of customization, Keep in mind, it is not like a wordpress template!

### Backend configurations

Most of backend customizations are in the `.env.prod` file
